# Scratch
Here I upload Games made in Scratch 2.0 (offline Editor & 3.0 online Editor)

Scratch is a no-code programming language. And it's good for new learners to motivate them program using graphics like making games.
So I am doing the same, making games to motivate them.

Games made:
1. Spaceship Game
2. Paddle ball Game
